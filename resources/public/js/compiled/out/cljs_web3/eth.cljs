                          transactions respectively. Or a filter options
                          object as follows:

    from-block: Number|String - The number of the earliest block (latest may be
                                given to mean the most recent and pending
                                currently mining, block). By default
                               latest.

                                logs from particular account(s).

    :topics: Array of Strings - An array of values which must each appear in the

                                `[null, '0x00...']`. You can also pass another array
                                for each topic with options for that topic e.g.
                                `[null, ['option1', 'option2']]`

    `(.get filter callback-fn)`:   Returns all of the log entries that fit the
                                   filter.
    `(.watch filter callback-fn)`: Watches for state changes that fit the
                                   filter and calls the callback.
    `(.stopWatching filter)`:      Stops the watch and uninstalls the filter in the
                                   node. Should always be called once it is done.

  Watch callback return value

    String - When using the \"latest\" parameter, it returns the block hash of
             the last incoming block.

    String - When using the \"pending\" parameter, it returns a transaction hash
             of the most recent pending transaction.
    Object - When using manual filter options, it returns a log object as follows:

        logIndex: Number - integer of the log index position in the block. null
                           when its pending log.
        transactionIndex: Number - integer of the transactions index position log
                                   was created from. null when its pending log.
        transactionHash: String, 32 Bytes - hash of the transactions this log was
                                            created from. null when its pending log.
        blockHash: String, 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this log was in. null
                                      when its pending. null when its pending log.
        blockNumber: Number - the block number where this log was in. null when its
                              pending. null when its pending log.
        address: String, 32 Bytes - address from which this log originated.
        data: String - contains one or more 32 Bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.

        topics: Array of Strings - Array of 0 to 4 32 Bytes DATA of indexed log
                                   arguments. (In solidity: The first topic is the hash
                                   of the signature of the event, except if you declared the
                                   event with the anonymous specifier.)
